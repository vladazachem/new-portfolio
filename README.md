# Project Title

A modern web application built with cutting-edge technologies for performance, scalability, and usability.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- ⚛️ **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- 🚀 **Next.js (15.0.3)** - A React framework for production-grade applications, supporting SSR, SSG, and API routes.

- 🌟 **GSAP** - A powerful JavaScript library for high-performance animations.

### **Backend**
- 💻 **Next.js (15.0.3)** - Also serves as the backend for API routes and server-side rendering.

### **Static Site Generation**
- 📄 **Next.js (15.0.3)** - For pre-rendering pages to optimize performance.

### **Deployment**
- ☁️ **Vercel** - A platform for deploying frontend and full-stack Next.js applications seamlessly.

### **Security**
- 🔒 **HSTS** - HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled to secure web communications.

## 💡 **Previous Version**
The earlier version of this project can be found here: [Codecademy_PPortfolio](https://github.com/vladazachem/Codecademy_PPortfolio).

In the previous version, the project was built using:
- **HTML** (54.7%)
- **CSS** (43.5%)
- **JavaScript** (1.8%)
- **Netlify** for deployment and as a CDN.

### My Technical Growth
This project is a reflection of my technical growth over time. Initially, I created a simpler version of my portfolio using basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While it served as a good starting point, I realized the need for scalability, maintainability, and improved user experience. In the current version, I utilized modern tools and frameworks such as **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP** to create a highly dynamic and responsive portfolio.

Additionally, I migrated from **Netlify** to **Vercel** for deployment, taking advantage of its seamless integration with Next.js. This transformation showcases my progression from static, manually written pages to a fully-fledged, optimized, and modular web application.
